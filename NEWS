Release

2.4	- Fixed a bug in asubst() that surfaced in 5.004_5X.

2.3	- Speed doubled from the release 2.2.

	- Stingy matching is now available.

	- Also the greedy matching got a little bit stingier:
	  earlier a match contained the next character if possible,
	  for example one unused deletion.  It does that no more.
	  This is evident in the $` $& $' and asubstitute().

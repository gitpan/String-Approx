Release

2.7	- Packaging problem fixed.

2.6	- A bug less.

2.5	- String::Approx had old $VERSION.
	- no more spreads $^W = 1.

2.4	- Fixed a bug in asubst() that surfaced in 5.004_5X.

2.3	- Speed doubled from the release 2.2.

	- Stingy matching is now available.

	- Also the greedy matching got a little bit stingier:
	  earlier a match contained the next character if possible,
	  for example one unused deletion.  It does that no more.
	  This is evident in the $` $& $' and asubstitute().

2.1	The patch level 2.1 fixes the following problems:

	- robustness for long patterns (comes at the price of speed,
	  about 10% slower when pattern > 10)

2.0_01	The patch level 2.0_01 fixes the following problems:

	- missing pod directive in Approx.pm ("Unmatched =back ..")
	- robustness when $_ is undefined

2.0	- the new, incompatible, API (though there is a backward compat mode)

	This Perl module implements approximate matching aka fuzzy matching.
	Also the substitution operation is supported.

	This release should be several times faster than the previous
	major release, v1.*, of String::Approx.

	The call syntax of this release is not directly downward compatible
	with the previous major release but there is a backward compability
	mode available.  This change was made both because of the speed-up
	work and because of the need to match also from somewhere else than
	just the $_.  I am sorry about this change but I hope the new speed
	and features make up for the inconvenience.

1.0	- the first release.

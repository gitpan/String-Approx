String::Approx ANNOUNCE

String::Approx v2.0_01

This Perl module implements approximate matching aka fuzzy matching.
Also the substitution operation is supported.

This release should be several times faster than the previous
major release, v1.*, of String::Approx.

The call syntax of this release is not directly downward compatible
with the previous major release but there is a backward compability
mode available.  This change was made both because of the speed-up
work and because of the need to match also from somewhere else than
just the $_.  I am sorry about this change but I hope the new speed
and features make up for the inconvenience.

The new release is available from

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/String/String-Approx-2.0.tar.Z

The patch level 2.0_01 fixes the following problems:

	- missing pod directive in Approx.pm
	- robustness when $_ is undefined

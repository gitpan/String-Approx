	* Released as 3.10.
	
	* apse.c: Fix an insidious buffer overrun, found by heroic
	debugging of J. D. Laub (already back in November 1999,
	but I'm amazingly good at procrastinating).  This is
	probably the bug that plagued String::Approx 3.0*
	in HP-UX and Solaris.  I couldn't anymore repeat it
	with in HP-UX, in Solaris it was still going strong.

	  going-to-match-no-matter-what" and "there-are-not-enough-edits-

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.06.
	
	* Approx.pm: Release 3.06: Fixed a bug in caching
	  of parsed parameters (the absolute length of the
	  pattern must be cached, too). (Reported by
	  Chris Rosin and Mark Land)

	* Approx.pm: Fixed a couple of typos and introduced
	  the coinage 'approximity' (to replace the clunky
	  'approximateness').

Thu Dec 17 13:17:58 1998  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.04.

	* Approx.pm: Fixed a parameter parsing bug: "i 1" was
	  not accepted. (Reported by Bob J.A. Schijvenaars)

	  the inputs are matched against the pattern, not the
	  other way round.

	* Approx.pm: Added a few C<>s and I<>s to the pod.

	* Approx.pm: Added an automatic flush to the pattern
	  compilation caches (triggered by a high water mark).

	  Makefile.PL had this, but better be paranoid.

Wed Dec 16 10:28:07 1998  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.03.

	* Approx.pm: Added confirmation from Udi Manber
	  to README: it's not a problem that I have looked
	  at agrep code.  My code is my code and can be
	  used within the limits set by my copyright.
	
	* Approx.xs: Removed a lot of the glue code
	  because it is not yet reachable via Approx.pm.
	  Later.
	
Wed Dec 16 01:23:58 1998  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	  with agrep.  There is no common code.  None.
	  Waiting for confirmation from Udi Manber.
	  (The concern raised by Slaven Rezic).
	
	* Approx.xs: fixed the PL_na mess for now, will
	  have to figure out the correct way.  Tested
	  under 5.004-maint, 5.005-maint, and 5.005-devel.

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.01 (actually already Dec 15).

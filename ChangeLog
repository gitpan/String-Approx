	* Approx.pm: Fixed parameter parsing bug: "i 1" was
	  not accepted. (Reported by Bob J.A. Schijvenaars)

	* Approx.pm: Documented that matching is asymmetric:
	  the inputs are matched against the pattern, not the
	  other way round.

	* Approx.pm: Added a few C<>s and I<>s to the pod.

	* Approx.pm: Added an automatic flush to the pattern
	  compilation caches.

	* Approx.pm: Added "require 5.004_04;", Previously only
	  Makefile.PL had this, but better be paranoid.

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.03.

	* Approx.pm: Added confirmation from Udi Manber
	  to README: it's not a problem that I have looked
	  at agrep code.  My code is my code and can be
	  used within the limits set by my copyright.
	
	* Approx.xs: Removed a lot of the glue code
	  because it is not yet reachable via Approx.pm.
	  Later.

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.02.

	* README: Added a clarification about our relationship
	  with agrep.  There is no common code.  None.
	  Waiting for confirmation from Udi Manber.
	  (The concern raised by Slaven Rezic).
	
	* Approx.xs: fixed the PL_na mess for now, will
	  have to figure out the correct way.  Tested
	  under 5.004-maint, 5.005-maint, and 5.005-devel.

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.01 (actually already Dec 15).

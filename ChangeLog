	  the coinage 'approximity' (to replace the clunky

Thu Dec 17 13:17:58 1998  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.04.

	* Approx.pm: Fixed a parameter parsing bug: "i 1" was
	  not accepted. (Reported by Bob J.A. Schijvenaars)

	  the inputs are matched against the pattern, not the
	  other way round.

	* Approx.pm: Added a few C<>s and I<>s to the pod.

	* Approx.pm: Added an automatic flush to the pattern
	  compilation caches (triggered by a high water mark).

	  Makefile.PL had this, but better be paranoid.

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.03.

	* Approx.pm: Added confirmation from Udi Manber
	  to README: it's not a problem that I have looked
	  at agrep code.  My code is my code and can be
	  used within the limits set by my copyright.
	
	* Approx.xs: Removed a lot of the glue code
	  because it is not yet reachable via Approx.pm.
	  Later.
	
Wed Dec 16 01:23:58 1998  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	  Waiting for confirmation from Udi Manber.
	  (The concern raised by Slaven Rezic).
	
	* Approx.xs: fixed the PL_na mess for now, will
	  have to figure out the correct way.  Tested
	  under 5.004-maint, 5.005-maint, and 5.005-devel.

	* Approx.pm: Released 3.01 (actually already Dec 15).
